Dotfiles and other configuration
================================

This repository contains various configuration bits that I use. Pretty
much everything is configured to use a Solarized Dark color scheme.

This repository uses git submodules. To clone use:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/omajid/config

Programs that are set up include:

- Emacs (with a ton of plugins, including Evil)
- Vim (with minimal plugins)
- Mutt
- AwesomeWM
- XTerm
- Tmux
